logics are found here, and all routes are directly linked by the conbtroller
        php artisan server
        php artisan make:controller Users
    app/Http/Controllers --- file location

Route::view('hello', 'hello');- limitations to it is that you cannot pass a parameter to it

Make component- reusable chunks of code that are redundant

        php artisan make:component Header
        use it on other pages= <x- header />
